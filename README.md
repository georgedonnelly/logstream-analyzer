# Self-Evolving Log Analysis Tool

A real-time log analysis tool that processes stdin log streams, detects patterns, and dynamically adapts to changing conditions.

## Features

- Real-time log processing with >1,000 entries/sec throughput
- Self-adjusting time window (30-120 seconds) based on processing rate
- Dynamic pattern detection and weighting
- Burst handling with adaptive buffer resizing
- Real-time terminal display updated every second
- Robust error handling for malformed logs

## Build and Run

### Requirements

- Go 1.16+

### Building the Tool

```bash
go build -o log_analyzer
```

### Running the Tool

Standard operation:
```bash
./log_generator.sh | ./log_analyzer
```

With debug logging:
```bash
./log_generator.sh | ./log_analyzer -debug
```

With custom buffer size (for testing burst detection):
```bash
./log_generator.sh | ./log_analyzer -buffer=500 -debug
```

For stress testing:
```bash
./log_generator_max.sh | ./log_analyzer -buffer=100 -debug
```

## Implementation Details

### Self-Adjusting Time Window

The analyzer begins with a 60-second sliding window that dynamically adjusts based on processing rate:
- When processing rate exceeds 400 entries/sec, the window shrinks down to a minimum of 30 seconds
- When processing rate falls below 600 entries/sec, the window expands up to 120 seconds
- All transitions are smooth with no data loss or display inconsistencies
- The current window size and previous size are clearly displayed in the UI

### Pattern Detection and Weighting

- The analyzer tracks error patterns and calculates their rate of change over time
- Error patterns receive tripled weight when their frequency quadruples in 10 seconds
- Emerging patterns with >100% increase are highlighted with their percentage spike
- A history of recent pattern spikes is maintained for trend analysis

### Burst Handling

- The tool detects sudden log bursts (high volume in a short period)
- When buffer usage exceeds 80%, the buffer is automatically resized by 1.5x
- Alerts are generated for buffer resizing events
- The implementation maintains performance during bursts through efficient processing

### Deliberate Concurrency Bug

The analyzer contains a deliberate concurrency flaw in the error counting logic:

```go
// In analyzer.go:
if entry.Level == "ERROR" && a.buggyConcurrency {
    // Bug: No lock protection when processing ERROR logs at high rates
    a.stats.EntriesProcessed++ // Missing lock, only triggered for ERROR logs
} else {
    a.mux.Lock()
    a.stats.EntriesProcessed++
    a.mux.Unlock()
}
```

This bug causes race conditions during high-volume ERROR log processing, resulting in:
- Underreporting of total processed entries
- Inconsistent error percentages under load
- The bug only manifests at high processing rates with many ERROR logs

To debug this issue:
1. Run with the Go race detector: `go build -race -o log_analyzer`
2. Test with high-volume ERROR logs using `log_generator_max.sh`
3. Look for inconsistencies in processed counts vs. expected counts

The fix is to ensure proper lock protection for all counter updates:
```go
a.mux.Lock()
a.stats.EntriesProcessed++
a.mux.Unlock()
```

## Architecture

The tool uses a multi-component architecture:

1. **Reader**: Parses stdin logs and sends them to the analyzer
2. **Analyzer**: Processes logs, detects patterns, and updates statistics
3. **Display**: Renders the current statistics to the terminal

Thread safety is ensured through:
- Go channels for communication between components
- Mutexes to protect shared data structures
- Careful synchronization of state updates

## Performance Characteristics

- Regular processing: >1,000 entries/sec
- Burst handling: Successfully processes 10,000+ entries/sec bursts
- Memory usage: Proportional to window size and log volume
- CPU usage: Linear with log processing rate

## Limitations and Future Improvements

- The sliding window implementation could be optimized further with a circular buffer
- Pattern detection is limited to the current log format
- UI is designed for terminal width of 80+ characters
